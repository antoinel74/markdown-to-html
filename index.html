        <p>Problems happens ! And as a creative mind, I always tend to bring <strong>new ideas</strong> to the team to solve them.<br>
    My one and only rule : <strong>never surrender !</strong> As a teammate, I always tend to do my best to provide the best I can for my team and also always here to help others if I can. I have the need to learn something new everyday and I always enjoy a nice tech/code <em>(or so-)</em> related conversation during lunch breaks, so come and say <em>Hi</em> :wave: ! </p>

    <h2 id="a-funny-story">A funny story</h2>
    <p>When I was a small kid, I believed that country were planets and that we kind of space-travel when going to holiday. 
        Unfortunately I was always sleeping during travel so I couldn't see anything. My parents of course encourage me that way....  I learn it the hard way making a joke of myself in the playground !</p>
